    <h2>Where all of your cupcake dreams come <strong>true</strong>.</h2>

    <p>Established in 1765, the Cupcake Shoppe has been around since <em>before</em> America.
       We are dedicated to providing the <strong>best</strong> cupcakes to our customers, even when
       cupcakes haven't been invented yet!</p>

    <h3 class="flashy">Cupcaketopia</h3>
    <p>We strongly believe that all cupcakes are created equal, and deserve to be loved equally
       under cucpcake law. Red Velvet isn't better than Carrot Cake, no matter what your cousin
       says. 

    <h4 class="flashy">Our Biggest Competition</h4>
    <p>Our biggest competition in the entire world, is probably <a href="https://milkbarstore.com"> Milk Bar</a>. We love Milk Bar, 
      and love all that they do for cakes and desserts.</p>
